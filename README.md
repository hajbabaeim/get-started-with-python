# Get started with python
Get started with Python programming language in different ways.
### Installtion
There are different ways to install Python on your machine. These approaches are listed as below:
- Pure Python (command line based) [[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)]
    + Highly recommended through cs-internship course
    + It's highly recommended to use [virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) in this method.
- Browser based IDE [[IPython](http://ipython.org/)]
    + The python package should be installed on your machine before using this IDE.
- Integrated Python distribution [[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com), [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)] 
    + Thess IDEs has its own package manager.
    + The Miniconda is lighter from Anaconda because it hasn't packages.

### *Installation notes*
- You should consider that Python2.7 won't supported by year 2020 anymore. So, it's highly recommended to use Python3.x through [cs-internship Python course](https://github.com/cs-internship/cs-internship-spec/tree/master/courses/python) and in your future projects ([Python2.x vs Python3.x](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/important-differences-between-python-2-x-and-python-3-x-with-examples/)).
- Using virtual environment is very professional approach which you should consider that all the time ([reasons](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41972261/what-is-a-virtualenv-and-why-should-i-use-one)).

### Usage
- **Pure Python package**
    + Just open the command prompt and write: *python*
        + *Note:* if you have Python2.7 beside Python3.+ on your machine, you should type *python3*
        + Using virtual env is a little bit different and you should do specific [steps](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

- **Editor (VSCode)**
    + Highly recommended ([download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))

### *To CS-Internship Python students*
- It's recommended to use the pure Python installation method alongside VSCode editor. Using the virtual-environment is a plus!
