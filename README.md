# get-started-with-python
Get started with Python programming language in different ways.
### Installtion
There are different ways to install Python on your machine. These approaches are listed as below:
- Browser based IDE [[IPython](http://ipython.org/)]
    + The python package should be installed on your machine before using this IDE.
- Integrated Python distribution [[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com), [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)] 
    + Thess IDEs has its own package manager.
    + The Miniconda is lighter from Anaconda because it hasn't packages.
- Pure Python (command line based) [[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)]
    + It's highly recommended to use [virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) in this method.

### Notes
- You should consider that Python2.7 wont supported by 2020 anymore. So, it's highly recommended to use Python3.+ through [cs-internship](https://github.com/cs-internship/cs-internship-spec/tree/master/courses) Python course and in your future projects.
- Using virtual environment through pure Python installation is very professional approach which you should consider that all the time ([reasons](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41972261/what-is-a-virtualenv-and-why-should-i-use-one)).

### Usage
- **pure Python package**
    + Just open the command prompt and write: *python*
    + *Note:* if you have Python2.7 beside Python3.+ on your machine, you should type *python3*
    + Using virtual env is a little bit different and you should do specific some [steps](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

### CS-Internship Python students
- It's recommended to use the pure Python installation method and using the virtual env is a plus!
